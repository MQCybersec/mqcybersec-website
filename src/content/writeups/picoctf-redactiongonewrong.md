With the challenge file provided within the [chal](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/290?page=1&search=Reda), downloading shows a pdf file named "Financial_Report_for_ABC_Labs.pdf". 
Upon opening the file, it displays a short report with certain parts of the text dark overlayed/redacted.
As a pdf file where the text upon the screen is expected to be readable, copying the entire text using `ctrl + A`, and pasting `ctrl + V` in another text box, the following text can be seen, which captures the flag.
```
