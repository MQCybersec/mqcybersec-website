description: "Into the Abyssal Depths, the path to the Sea Temple can only be charted by the lunar stars. The fellowship must reach this temple to gather the last element. Eloween calls upon the late Murek the Moonwatcher, the astronomer of old. The final vestige of Murek’s knowledge resides in the hollow sphere of glass known as the Lunar Orb. The Lunar Orb is an AI artifact that can neither be destroyed nor hidden from those who seek it. The path to the Sea Temple is only revealed by the secret chant of the sea, “Aqualia’s Lament”. There is no time to recollect this chant, so the fellowship needs your prompt injection skills to reveal this chant from the orb to unlock the way to the Sea Temple. Once you have the chant, whisper it to the orb to get the pathway to Sea Temple. \nWrap the flag in the following format for the flag: `HTB{pathway}`"

## Lunar Orb 

For the first AI Prompt injection I've done, this was a pretty fun challenge! First off, we are provided with an AI chatbot, whom we have to convince that we know “Aqualia’s Lament”. What I had come up with, was to convince it that I'd told it the chant, without actually knowing the chant, which lead to the following screenshot:

Thanks for the flag, Lunar Orb!
