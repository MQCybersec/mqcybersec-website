# Breaking the Authentication

## Challenge Overview

The challenge presented a login page with seemingly robust security measures. The goal was to bypass the authentication and access the admin panel.

## Reconnaissance

First, we examined the login form and found it was making POST requests to `/api/login`. Using the browser's developer tools, we analyzed the request and response patterns.

```javascript
// Sample login request
fetch('/api/login', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    username: 'admin',
    password: 'password'
  })
})
